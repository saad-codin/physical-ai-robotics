## What Makes This Textbook Different

Traditional robotics textbooks often present concepts in isolation. Our approach connects all the dots:

- **Integrated Learning**: Each module builds upon the others, showing how ROS 2, simulation, AI, and VLA systems work together
- **AI-Powered Assistance**: Our RAG chatbot helps you understand concepts and solve problems as you learn
- **Personalized Path**: Content adapts to your experience level and learning preferences
- **Practical Focus**: Every concept is grounded in practical applications

## What's New in 2025

This year brings exciting updates to our curriculum:

- **Enhanced VLA Integration**: Deeper coverage of Vision-Language-Action models for humanoid robotics
- **Latest ROS 2 Features**: Updated content covering ROS 2 Iron and Jazzy releases
- **Advanced AI Techniques**: New sections on foundation models for robotics and embodied AI
- **Real-World Case Studies**: Analysis of cutting-edge humanoid robots like Figure 01, Tesla Optimus, and 1X NEO
- **Interactive Simulations**: Improved digital twin environments for hands-on practice
